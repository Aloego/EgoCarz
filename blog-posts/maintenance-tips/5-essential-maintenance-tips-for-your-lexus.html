                <h3>1. Regular Oil Changes</h3>
                <p>
                  Engine oil is the lifeblood of your Lexus. Change your oil and
                  oil filter every 5,000 to 10,000 km (or as recommended in your
                  owner’s manual) to ensure optimal engine performance and
                  longevity. Use only high-quality oil suitable for your model.
                </p>
                <h3>2. Inspect and Replace Air Filters</h3>
                <p>
                  Clean air filters improve fuel efficiency and engine health.
                  Check your engine and cabin air filters every 10,000 km and
                  replace them if they appear dirty or clogged. This is
                  especially important in dusty environments.
                </p>
                <h3>3. Monitor Tire Pressure and Condition</h3>
                <p>
                  Properly inflated tires improve safety, fuel economy, and ride
                  comfort. Check your tire pressure monthly and before long
                  trips. Rotate your tires every 10,000 km and inspect for
                  uneven wear or damage.
                </p>
                <h3>4. Keep Up with Fluid Levels</h3>
                <p>
                  Regularly check coolant, brake fluid, transmission fluid, and
                  windshield washer fluid. Top up or replace as needed, and
                  watch for leaks under your vehicle. Low or dirty fluids can
                  lead to costly repairs.
                </p>
                <h3>5. Schedule Professional Inspections</h3>
                <p>
                  Even if your Lexus seems fine, have it inspected by a
                  certified technician at least once a year. They can spot
                  issues early, update software, and ensure your car’s systems
                  are running perfectly.
                </p>
